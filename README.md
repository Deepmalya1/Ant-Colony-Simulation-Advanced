# Ant Colony Simulation

## Overview

This project features an ant colony simulation with two versions:

1. **Python Pygame Version**: A desktop application created using Python and Pygame.
2. **Web Version**: A web-based simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The simulation visualizes ants moving across a grid, leaving pheromone trails, and reproducing. Users can interact with various controls to modify simulation parameters and view detailed statistics.

## Features

- **Python Pygame Version**:
 
  - Speed Adjustment (including Fast Forward)[ -> to fast forward]

- **Web Version**:
  - Start/Stop Simulation
  - Speed Adjustment (including Fast Forward)
  - Reset Speed
  - Increase Reproduction Rate
  - Toggle Visibility (Only Pheromones or Both Ants and Pheromones)
  - Final Reset (Clear Canvas)

## Project Structure

### Python Pygame Version

- **main.py**: Main script that runs the Pygame simulation.
- **README.md**: This file.

### Web Version

- **index.html**: HTML file that structures the simulation interface.
- **styles.css**: CSS file for styling the simulation.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file for handling the simulation logic.
